-: What is Redux?
Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application 
state, using events called "actions". It serves as a centralized store for 
state that needs to be used across your entire application,

-: Redux Libraries and Tools
Redux is a small standalone JS library. However, it is commonly used 
with several other packages:

React-Redux
React-Redux is our official package that lets your React components 
interact with a Redux store by reading pieces of state and dispatching 
actions to update the store

Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit is our recommended approach for writing Redux logic. 
It contains packages and functions that we think are essential for 
building a Redux app.
