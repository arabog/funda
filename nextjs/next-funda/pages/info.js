By default, React runs on the client side (meaning that it
runs on the web browser), so a web application written 
entirely with that library could negatively affect Search 
Engine Optimization (SEO) and initial load performance, 
as it takes some time to be correctly rendered on screen. 
In fact, to display the complete web app, the browser 
had to download the entire application bundle, parse 
its content, then execute it and render the result in the 
browser, which could take up to a few seconds (with
very large applications).

Vercel came up with Next.js, which has turned out to 
be a game-changer.

In fact, every JavaScript file inside the pages/ directory 
will be a public page, so if you try to duplicate the index.js 
page and rename it about.js , you'll be able to go to 
http://localhost:3000/about and see an exact copy of your 
home page.
