Search engine bots make no difference; they only care 
about website content and quality.


There are specific SEO metrics that might be a bit out of 
our control when developing the website. Domain authority, 
referring domains, page impressions, click-through rate,
and organic market share are just a few of them. Even
though we are unlikely to improve those metrics during the 
development process (as they are the product of good content
management on the website), we should do our best to improve 
whatever we can by coding the website.

1. Creating an SEO-friendly routing structure:
https://myblog.com/posts/how-to-deal-with-seo is a better URL,
which tells us that on this page, we're talking about SEO and 
how to deal with it. than this: https://myblog.com/posts/1

2. Fill the pages with correct and complete metadata:
This is essential data that we should always include in our pages, 
with no exception. There are great libraries such as next-seo 
( https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo )

3. Optimize your images: We've already talked about how 
we can optimize images.

4. Generate a proper sitemap: Once we're ready to deploy a website, 
we can submit the sitemap to search engines to help them index our 
content. A well-made sitemap is essential for any website as it allows 
the creation of a neat, structured path for search engines to follow to 
index the site
eg: nextjs-sitemap-generator 
https://github.com/IlusionDev/nextjs-sitemap-generator

5. Use the correct HTML tags: Using semantic HTML tags to build 
a website is essential as they tell the search engine bots how to index 
the content in terms of priority and importance.

-: Dealing with performance
Performance and SEO are two important aspects of any web 
application. Performance, in particular, can affect the SEO 
score, as a lousy-performing website will lower the
SEO score.

Another thing that can potentially increase (or decrease) performance is 
the deployment platform. For instance, if you're deploying a Next.js static 
website to a CDN such as Cloudflare or AWS Cloudfront, you're likely to 
get the best possible performance

-: A brief introduction to different deployment platforms
While thinking about a new web application, we have many things 
to consider. For example, how do we want to render its pages, which 
styling method do we want to adopt, where does data come from, how 
do we manage the application state, and where do we want to deploy 
the application itself?

Focusing on that last part, we could split one problem into two: where 
do we want to deploy our application and how do we want to do it?
In fact, most of the time, choosing a deployment platform also means 
selecting a slightly different deployment method.
