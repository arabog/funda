/*
Profiler API
The Profiler measures how often a React application renders and 
what the “cost” of rendering is. Its purpose is to help identify parts 
of an application that are slow and may benefit from optimizations 
such as memoization.

Note:
Profiling adds some additional overhead, so it is disabled in the 
production build.
