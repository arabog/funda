/*
Integrating with Other Libraries
React can be used in any web application. It can be embedded in 
other applications and, with a little care, other applications can 
be embedded in React. This guide will examine some of the more 
common use cases, focusing on integration with jQuery and Backbone, 
but the same ideas can be applied to integrating components with 
any existing code.
