/*
JSX In Depth
Fundamentally, JSX just provides syntactic sugar for the 
React.createElement(component, props, ...children) function. 
The JSX code:

<MyButton color="blue" shadowSize={2}>
          Click Me
</MyButton>

compiles into:
React.createElement(
          MyButton,
          {color: 'blue', shadowSize: 2},
          'Click Me'
)

You can also use the self-closing form of the tag if there are no children. So:

<div className="sidebar" />

compiles into:
React.createElement(
          'div',
          {className: 'sidebar'}
)


-: Specifying The React Element Type
The first part of a JSX tag determines the type of the React element.

Capitalized types indicate that the JSX tag is referring to a React 
component. These tags get compiled into a direct reference to the 
named variable, so if you use the JSX <Foo /> expression, Foo 
must be in scope.

React Must Be in Scope
Since JSX compiles into calls to React.createElement, the React 
library must also always be in scope from your JSX code.

For example, both of the imports are necessary in this code, even 
though React and CustomButton are not directly referenced from 
JavaScript:

import React from 'react';
import CustomButton from './CustomButton';

function WarningButton() {
          // return React.createElement(CustomButton, {color: 'red'}, null);
          return <CustomButton color="red" />;
}

If you donâ€™t use a JavaScript bundler and loaded React from a 
<script> tag, it is already in scope as the React global.
