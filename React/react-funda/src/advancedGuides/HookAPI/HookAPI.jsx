/*
Hooks API Reference
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other 
React features without writing a class.

Basic Hooks
useState
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.

During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value 
passed as the first argument (initialState).

The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value 
and enqueues a re-render of the component.

setState(newState);

During subsequent re-renders, the first value returned by useState will 
always be the most recent state after applying updates.

Functional updates
If the new state is computed using the previous state, you can pass a 
function to setState. The function will receive the previous value, and 
return an updated value. Hereâ€™s an example of a counter component 
that uses both forms of setState:


function Counter({initialCount}) {
          const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
          
          return (
                    <>
                              Count: {count}

                              <button onClick={() => setCount(initialCount)}>Reset</button>

                              <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}>-</button>
                              
                              <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>+</button>
                    </>
          );
}
