Optimizing Performance
Internally, React uses several clever techniques to minimize the 
number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI. 
For many applications, using React will lead to a fast user 
interface without doing much work to specifically optimize for 
performance. Nevertheless, there are several ways you can speed 
up your React application.
